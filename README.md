# Cross species annotation of spinal V1 interneurons

Spinal interneurons' role in motor processes is essential and multiple eletrophysiological studies have been conducted to study their potential roles. Some subtypes have been defined, but never has there been a complete characterization of these interneurons their roles, transcriptomic and morphological profiles. 

This analysis uses cross-species transcriptomics to characterize human spinal V1 interneurons.
